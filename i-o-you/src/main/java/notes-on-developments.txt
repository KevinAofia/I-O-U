models: contains the models of the MySQL DB
	Expense
	ReimbursementStatus
	
daos: contains the DAOs & JDBC connection for communicating to the DB
	ExpenseDAO
	ReimbursementStatusDAO
	
	
servlets: contains the servlets
	ExpenseServlet

	
Project Refreshers & Notes on Build:

Check Dependencies:
	JAVAX for HTTP handling using servlets
	JDBC DRIVER for communicating to MySQL DB
	JACKSON for JSON processing libraries & ObjectMapper

Build using the DAO design pattern using JDBC

Steps for JDBC:
	1. Load the JDBC Driver into memory
	2. Establish a connection JDBC Driver Object
	3. Create an SQL statement
	4. Use the connection object to execute the SQL statement
	5. Parse the returned ResultSet object for the data we want
	6. Close the connection
	NOTE: When using JDBC Driver Manager, the Driver must be registered
	before connection to the MySQL DB


Implement JDBC CRUD methods using DAO's and models

Using servlets, test GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests using Postman

Servlet should implement DAO's keeping in mind to convert Java -> JSON
and JSON to Java to achieve a working API over HTTP

Jackson libraries will provide a JSON processing library we can use
ObjectMapper is the primarily used object to achieve this

Be sure to handle CORS issues that may arise

Connect to react
	node.js needs to be installed before you can develop react application
	In working directory run:
	create react application with npx create-react-app .  
	
	Then run:
	run npm start
	
	If you are cloning and node modules is not present after clone run:
	npm install

	Install library that is capable of fetching data from an API
	
	This project is using axios(an AJAX library):
	axios - a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser which
	eases the process of sending asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints
	and performing CRUD operations

	To install, stop react ctrl-c, and run in working directory:
	npm i axios
	
Entry point for any react app is index.js

Define our own App.js or App.jsx
	must export either using 'default export [AppName]' at bottom or 
	by using named exports 'export const [AppName]' in declaration
	1 default export per file
