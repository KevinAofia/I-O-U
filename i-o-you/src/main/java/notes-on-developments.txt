models: contains the models of the MySQL DB
	Expense
	ReimbursementStatus
	
daos: contains the DAOs & JDBC connection for communicating to the DB
	ExpenseDAO
	ReimbursementStatusDAO
	
	
servlets: contains the servlets
	ExpenseServlet

	
Project Refreshers & Notes on Build:

Check Dependencies:
	JAVAX for HTTP handling using servlets
	JDBC DRIVER for communicating to MySQL DB
	JACKSON for JSON processing libraries & ObjectMapper

Build using the DAO design pattern using JDBC

Steps for JDBC:
	1. Load the JDBC Driver into memory
	2. Establish a connection JDBC Driver Object
	3. Create an SQL statement
	4. Use the connection object to execute the SQL statement
	5. Parse the returned ResultSet object for the data we want
	6. Close the connection
	NOTE: When using JDBC Driver Manager, the Driver must be registered
	before connection to the MySQL DB


Implement JDBC CRUD methods using DAO's and models

Using servlets, test GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests using Postman

Servlet should implement DAO's keeping in mind to convert Java -> JSON
and JSON to Java to achieve a working API over HTTP

Jackson libraries will provide a JSON processing library we can use
ObjectMapper is the primarily used object to achieve this
